    "text": "The Rubik’s Cube is a popular 6-sided twisty puzzle first invented in the 1974 by Erno Rubik. Since the late 2000s, the cube’s popularity has made a comeback. Many people enjoy the competitive aspect of the cube, aiming to solve it as fast as possible. The current 3x3 single world record is 3.05 seconds by Xuanyi Geng from China. The current 3x3 average world record is 3.90 seconds by Yiheng Wang from China.\nOfficial Rubik’s Cube competitions are governed by the World Cube Association (WCA), an entirely volunteer run non-profit organization that was founded in 2004. More than 273,000 people have competed in WCA sanctioned competitions. Competitions are held every week worldwide, but the geographic distribution of competition certainly isn’t even. The United States has had over 2,000 cube competitions while other countries have had less than 10 or even none.\nMy project aims to determine the relationship between the density of competitions in a given country and the speed of a country’s competitors. I have 2 main research questions: How are World Cube Association competitions geographically distributed? Is the density of WCA competitions correlated to the speed of the competitors in the region?"
